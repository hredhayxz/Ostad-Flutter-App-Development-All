This is my application output descriptive image of the weather is not colorful because I cannot get colourful data from OpenWeatherMap database via API ( https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=khulna&appid=8b5ccf4725ba84043b991cfcc8ed93b9&units=metric ) . Thank you.

Create a simple weather app that fetches and displays the current weather conditions for a user's location.

 

Requirements



    The app should display the user's current location and the current weather conditions, including the temperature and weather description (e.g. sunny, cloudy, etc.) with a descriptive image of the weather.



    The app shows a loading indicator when data is being fetched from the api.



    The app should display an error message if there is a problem fetching the weather data.



    You may use a custom font for the temperature and weather description.



    You can use the OpenWeatherMap API or any free weather API to fetch weather data.

    


 







Guidelines

Do not use a weather-specific package or library (e.g. Flutter Weather, OpenWeather).
